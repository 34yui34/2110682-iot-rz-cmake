new s21i

for teaching interrupt programming

Want a single core cpu with timer-interrupt.  Modify s21i  to have many interrupt vectors.  Accept the object file from as23 which produces object of s23 (single format variation of s21).  Read object and recode it to be s22 (original three formats: L, D, X) with addition instructions: int, reti, push, pop, savr, resr, savt, rest.

trap now has one argument:  trap r28 #0
reg is in r1-field, trap number is in r3-field

currently support only:  reti  

trap function
  trap r0 #0    stop
  trap r1 #1    print int from r1
  trap r1 #2    print char from r1
  trap r1 #14   set interrupt interval to r1
  trap r0 #15   disable interrupt
  trap r0 #16   enable interrupt

interrupt 
  interrupt vector is stored in M[1000].  There is only one level interrupt. During the execution of interrupt service routine, interrupt is disable.  After return from interrupt, it is enable.  There can not be nested interrupt.  The interrupt interval can be set by "trap r1 #14". By default, it is 100 (instruction unit).
